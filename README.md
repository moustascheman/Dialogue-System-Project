### My Dialogue Editor

A Node-Based Dialogue Editor and System made for the Unity Game Engine by Rahman Ahmed

This is a node-based Dialogue Editor that I built to help speed up the development of complex dialogue trees.
This Editor includes branching and Dialogue Choices and comes with a basic example Demo.
